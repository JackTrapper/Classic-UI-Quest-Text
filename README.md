Classic-UI-Quest-Text
================

Causes quest text to fade in like in the old classic versions of WoW. Also, the "Quest Window" AddOn is available, which will change the quest window shape to look like it did before Cataclysm.

This addon restores the old good scrolling quest text known from patches 1.x to 3.x, that was active when the "Instant Quest Text" option was disabled.

However, it can be skipped anytime, so you do not have to wait if you don't want!

If you want to skip the scrolling for a single time, click anywhere inside the quest window.

The control of fading speed and gradient length is available via standard globals (QUEST_DESCRIPTION_GRADIENT_CPS and QUEST_DESCRIPTION_GRADIENT_LENGTH). You can change them by typing "/script var=value".

This addon is a part of the in-development Classic UI suite.
